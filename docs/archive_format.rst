=============================
.7z file format specification
=============================

Abstract
========

7-zip archive is one of popular files compression and archive formats. There has been
no well-defined file format specification document in 20 years from its birth, so
it is not considered application defined format.

There are some independent implementation of utility to handle 7-zip archives, it is necessary
to prepare a precise format specification documentation to keep compatibility and interoperability.

This specification defines an archive file format of 7-zip archive.
This specification is derived from 7zFormat.txt bundled with p7zip utility which is portable
7-zip implementation. Its details are retrieved from knowledge got by reverse engineering effort
of p7zip implementation.

Introduction
================

Purpose
-----------

This specification is intended to define a cross-platform, interoperable file storage and
transfer format  The information here is meant to be a concise guide for those wishing
to implement libraries and utility to handle 7-zip archive files.

Intended audience
-----------------

This specification is intended for use by implementors of software to compress files into 7-zip format and/or
decompress files from 7-zip format.

The text of the specification assumes a basic background in programming
at the level of bits and other primitive data representations.

Scope
---------

"7-zip archive" is one of popular files compression and archive formats.
It is universally used to aggregate, compress, and encrypt files into a single
interoperable container. No specific use or application need is
defined by this format and no specific implementation guidance is
provided. This document provides details on the storage format for
creating 7-zip files.  Information is provided on the records and
fields that describe what a .7z file is.

This specification does not provide technical specification of compression methods
such as LZMA, LZMA2, Delta, BCJ and every other methods.
It also does not provide technical specification of encryption and hash methods
such as AES and SHA256.

Motivation
==========

There are several file archive format and utilities.  Many of them are born as proprietary format
of archive utility software, because of its nature, only standardized formats are now alived
as portable, stable for long time and freely usable specification.
PKWare ZIP, GNU Tar and GZip are examples for it.
Since 7-zip, its format and algorithm LZMA/LZMA2 are born as public-domain in 1999,
it is known as one of long lived file format.

There are two effort to make 7zip as a well-documented and portable format.
One is a documentation project here, and other is a software development project
to be independent and compatible with original 7zip and p7zip utility such as py7zr.

Diagram conventions
-------------------

In the diagrams below, a box like this:

::

    +---+
    |   | <-- the vertical bars might be missing
    +---+


represents one byte.

When specified with character with single quote, it means a constant
value of specified character.

An example bellow means a data '7' ie. 0x37  is placed as one byte.

::

    +---+
    |'7'|
    +---+


When two digit of hexadecimal alphabet and number(0-9A-F) is placed,
it means a constant of specified value.

An example bellow means a constant 0xFF is placed as one byte.

::

    +---+
    | FF|
    +---+

A box like this:

::

    +==============+
    |              |
    +==============+


represents a variable number of bytes.
When label is placed, it refers other field defined in this document.

::

    +=============================+
    | Signature Header            |
    +=============================+


When label is placed inside '( )' bracket, it express the field is optional.

::

    +=============================+
    | (Packed Streams)            |
    +=============================+


When two or more labels are placed inside '( )' bracket separeted with bartical bar '|',
it express the field is selectable.

::

    +=============================+
    | (A | B)                     |
    +=============================+


This example means a field is mandatory but it can be A or B.

When adding a block bracket '[]' at end of label, it means the field is a list of
values or repeatable.

::

    +=============================+
    | CRCs of packed stream[]     |
    +=============================+

When label is placed at a block bracket, it means a length of a list.

Data Representations
====================

This chapter describes basic data representations used in 7-zip file.

Integers and byte order
-----------------------

All integers that require more than one byte SHALL be in a little endian,
Least significant byte (LSB) comes first, then more significant bytes in
ascending order of significance (LSB MSB for two byte integers, B0 B1 B2 B3
for four bytes integers). The highest bit (value 128) of byte is number bit 7
and lowest bit (value 1) is number bit 0. Values are unsigned unless otherwise
noted.


UINT32
^^^^^^

UINT32 SHALL be an integer value stored in 4 bytes at little endian,
representing a integer rage from 0 to 4,294,967,295 (0xffffffff).

::

      0   1   2   3
    +---+---+---+---+
    |               |
    +---+---+---+---+


REAL_UINT64
^^^^^^^^^^^

REAL_UINT64 SHALL be an integer value stored in 8 bytes at little endian,
representing a integer range from 0 to 18446744073709551615 (0xffffffffffffffff)
It may also known as unsigned long long.

File format
===========

7-zip archive file format SHALL consist of three part.
7-zip archive file SHALL start with signature header.
The data block SHOULD placed after the signature header.
The data block is shown as Packed Streams.

A header database SHOULD be placed after the data block.
The data block MAY be empty when no archived contents exists.
So Packed Streams is optional.

Since Header database CAN be encoded then it SHOULD place
after data block, that is Packed Streams for Headers.
When Header database is encoded, Header encode Information
SHALL placed instead of Header.

When Header database is placed as plain form,
Packed Streams for Headers SHALL NOT exist.

Each Folder has coder information. CoderInfo is consist of flag,
number of streams and properties.

Flag indicate the coder is simple i.e. single input and single output,
or comprex i.e. multiple input, multiple output.

When simple coder, number of streams is always one for input,
and one for output, so it SHALL be skipped.

Appendix: Rationale
===================

Byte order
----------

It has been asked why 7-zip uses little endian byte order. It is a historical reason,
that 7-zip was born as Microsoft Windows application in 1999, and its file format was
a windows application format, when only little endian was used on target platform.

CRC32
-----

CRC32 is a checksum.

Encode
------

Encode in this document express compressed, encrypted and/or filter data. When encoding,
it should lead encoding metadata.

Extract
-------

Extract in this document express decompress, decryption and/or filter data from archive.


UTF-16-LE
---------

Unicode UTF-16 encoding uses 2 bytes or 4 bytes to represent Unicode character.
Because it is not one byte ordering, we need to consider endian, byte order.
UTF-16-LE is a variant of UTF-16 definition which use Little-Endian for store data.

Appendix: CRC algorithm (informative)
=====================================

Chunk CRCs are calculated using standard CRC methods with pre and post conditioning,
as defined by ISO 3309 [ISO-3309] or ITU-T V.42 [ITU-T-V42]. The CRC polynomial employed is

::

   x^32+x^26+x^23+x^22+x^16+x^12+x^11+x^10+x^8+x^7+x^5+x^4+x^2+x+1

The 32-bit CRC register is initialized to all 1's, and then the data from each byte
is processed from the least significant bit (1) to the most significant bit (128).
After all the data bytes are processed, the CRC register is inverted
(its ones complement is taken).
This value is transmitted (stored in the file) MSB first.
For the purpose of separating into bytes and ordering, the least significant bit of
the 32-bit CRC is defined to be the coefficient of the x31 term.

Practical calculation of the CRC always employs a precalculated table to greatly
accelerate the computation
