SevenZipFile Class Usage
========================

py7zr is a library which can use in your python application.

Decompression/Decryption
------------------------

Here is a code snippet how to decompress some file in your application.

.. code-block:: python

    import py7zr

    archive = py7zr.SevenZipFile('sample.7z', mode='r')
    archive.extractall(path="/tmp")
    archive.close()



You can also use 'with' block because py7zr provide context manager(v0.6 and later).

.. code-block:: python

    import py7zr

    with py7zr.SevenZipFile('sample.7z', mode='r') as z:
        z.extractall()

    with py7zr.SevenZipFile('target.7z', 'w') as z:
        z.writeall('./base_dir')


py7zr also supports extraction of single or selected files by 'extract(targets=['file path'])'.
Note: if you specify only a file but not a parent directory, it will fail.

.. code-block:: python

    import py7zr
    import re

    filter_pattern = re.compile(r'<your/target/file_and_directories/regex/expression>')
    with SevenZipFile('archive.7z', 'r') as archive:
        allfiles = archive.getnames()
        selective_files = [f if filter_pattern.match(f) for f in allfiles]
        archive.extract(targets=selective_files)


py7zr support an extraction of password protected archive.(v0.6 and later)

.. code-block:: python

    import py7zr

    with py7zr.SevenZipFile('encrypted.7z', mode='r', password='secret') as z:
        z.extractall()

Compression/Encryption
----------------------

Here is a code snippet how to produce archive.

.. code-block:: python

    import py7zr

    with py7zr.SevenZipFile('target.7z', 'w') as archive:
        archive.writeall('/path/to/base_dir', 'base')


To create encrypted archive, please pass a password.

.. code-block:: python

    import py7zr

    with py7zr.SevenZipFile('target.7z', 'w', password='secret') as archive:
        archive.writeall('/path/to/base_dir', 'base')


To create archive with algorithms such as zstandard, you can call with custom filter.

.. code-block:: python

    import py7zr

    my_filters = [{"id": py7zr.FILTER_ZSTD}]
    another_filters = [{"id": py7zr.FILTER_ARM}, {"id": py7zr.FILTER_LZMA2, "preset": 7}]
    with py7zr.SevenZipFile('target.7z', 'w', filters=my_filter) as archive:
        archive.writeall('/path/to/base_dir', 'base')


shutil helper
=============

py7zr also support `shutil`  interface.

.. code-block:: python

    from py7zr import pack_7zarchvie, unpack_7zarchive
    import shutil

    # register file format at first.
    shutil.register_archive_format('7zip', pack_7zarchive, description='7zip archive')
    shutil.register_unpack_format('7zip', ['.7z'], unpack_7zarchive)

    # extraction
    shutil.unpack_archive('test.7z', '/tmp')

    # compression
    shutil.make_archive('target', '7zip', 'src')


Required Python versions
========================

`py7zr` uses a python3 standard `lzma module`_ for extraction and compression.
The standard lzma module uses `liblzma`_ that support core compression algorithm of 7zip.

Minimum required version is Python 3.6.
Multi-volume archive creation is supported on Python 3.7 and later.

Version recommendations are:

- CPython 3.7.5, CPython 3.8.0 and later.
- PyPy3.6-7.2.0 and later.

Following fixes are included in these versions, and it is not fixed on python3.6.

- `BPO-21872`_: LZMA library sometimes fails to decompress a file
- `PyPy3-3090`_: lzma.LZMADecomporessor.decompress does not respect max_length


.. _`lzma module`: https://docs.python.org/3/library/lzma.html
.. _`liblzma`: https://tukaani.org/xz/
.. _`BPO-21872`: https://bugs.python.org/issue21872
.. _`PyPy3-3090`: https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/3090


Compression Methods supported
=============================

'py7zr' supports algorithms and filters which `lzma module`_ and `liblzma`_ support.
It also support BZip2 and Deflate that are implemented in python core libraries,
and ZStandard with third party libraries.

Supported algorithms are:

* compress
    * LZMA2
    * LZMA
    * Bzip2
    * Deflate
    * Copy
    * PPMd
    * Zstandard

* crypt
    * 7zAES

* Filters
    * Delta
    * BCJ(X86,ARMT,ARM,PPC,SPARC,IA64)

* No supported
    * BCJ2
    * Deflate64

- A feature handling symbolic link is basically compatible with 'p7zip' implementation,
  but not work with original 7-zip because the original does not implement the feature.

Dependencies
============

There are several dependencies to support algorithms and CLI expressions.

================  ================================
Package           Purpose
================  ================================
`Pycryptodome`_   7zAES encryption
`ppmd-cffi`_      PPMd compression
`bcj-cffi`_       BCJ filter
`pyzstd`_         ZStandard compression
`texttable`_      CLI
================  ================================

.. _`Pycryptodome` : https://pypi.org/project/pycryptodome/
.. _`ppmd-cffi` : https://pypi.org/project/ppmd-cffi/
.. _`bcj-cffi` : https://pypi.org/project/bcj-cffi/
.. _`pyzstd` : https://pypi.org/project/pyzstd
.. _`texttable` : https://pypi.org/project/texttable


Performance
===========

You can find a compression and decompression benchmark results at
[Github issue](https://github.com/miurahr/py7zr/issues/297) and [wiki page](https://github.com/miurahr/py7zr/wiki/Benchmarks)

Benchmarks are run with Github Actions manually triggered at
[Github actions workflow](https://github.com/miurahr/py7zr/actions/workflows/run-benchmark.yml)

py7zr works well, but slower than `7-zip` and `p7zip` C implementation by several reasons.
When compression/decompression **speed** is quite important, it is recommended to use these
alternatives through `subprocess.run` python interface.

Use Cases
=========

- `aqtinstall`_ Another (unofficial) Qt (aqt) CLI Installer on multi-platforms.
- PreNLP_ Preprocessing Library for Natural Language Processing
- mlox_  a tool for sorting and analyzing Morrowind plugin load order
