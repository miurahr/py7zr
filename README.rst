Pure python 7-zip implementation


Dependency
==========

It uses a standard lzma module and its API supported.
It also uses type definitions introduced in Python3.6.

Minimum required version is Python 3.5.

Version recommendations are:

- CPython 3.7.5, CPython 3.8.0 and later.
- PyPy3.6-7.2.0 and later.

Following fixes are included in above versions and python3.6 series is not fixed it.

- `BPO-21872`_: LZMA library sometimes fails to decompress a file
- `PyPy3-3088`_: lzma.LZMADecomporessor.decompress does not respect max_length

.. _`PyPy3-3088`: https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/issues/3088/lzmalzmadecompressordecompress-data


Document
========

Here is a readthedocs `manual`_ document.

Usage
=====

You can run command script py7zr like as follows;

.. code-block::

    $ py7zr l test.7z
    $ py7zr x test.7z
    $ py7zr w target.7z test_dir


py7zr is a library which can use in your pyhton application.
Here is a code snippet how to decompress some file in your applicaiton.

.. code-block::

    import py7zr

    archive = py7zr.SevenZipFile('sample.7z', mode='x')
    archive.extractall(path="/tmp")
    archive.close()


Here is a code snippet how to produce archive.

.. code-block::

    import py7zr

    archvie = py7zr.SevenZipFile('target.7z', 'w')
    archive.writeall('./base_dir')
    archive.close()


py7zr also support `shutil`  interface.

.. code-block::

    from py7zr import pack_7zarchvie, unpack_7zarchive
    import shutil

    # register file format at first.
    shutil.register_archive_format('7zip', pack_7zarchive, description='7zip archive')
    shutil.register_unpack_format('7zip', ['.7z'], unpack_7zarchive)

    # extraction
    shutil.unpack_archive('test.7z', '/tmp')

    # compression
    shutil.make_archive('target', '7zip', 'src')
